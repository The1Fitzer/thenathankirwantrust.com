									<h1>About Nathan</h1>
									<p><br /></p>
									<p>Nathan suffered a serious spinal cord injury in June 2013 as result of a fall from a tree. He has 
									been diagnosed with a C4 injury and has been left paralysed from the chest down, including no function 
									in his hands or fingers.</p>
									<p><br /></p>
									<p>Nathan has always been a remarkable character, but since his accident he has been a true inspiration 
									to so many. In such times of adversity, with his whole life as he knew it turned completely upside down, 
									Nathan faces every day with an overwhelming sense of courage, positivity and determination; greeting each 
									new challenge he faces with hope and optimism. He had just graduated as a Marine Engineer, and was due to 
									begin the next chapter of his life working as an engineer on board a cruise-ship sailing around the 
									world. This will now not happen.</p>
									<p><br /></p>
									<p>The support shown by the hundreds of people who have fundraised, helped and supported Nathan so far
									is a true testament to the type of person Nathan is. We want to ensure that Nathan has the best quality
									of life possible and to ensure that he fulfills his hopes and ambitions as a courageous, intelligent and 
									hardworking young man.</p>
